# Python Basics

This folder covers core Python fundamentals from the Boot.dev curriculum.

Syntactic notes are kept in [`NOTES.md`](./NOTES.md) as a quick reference.  
Deep dives into subjects I struggled with are documented in concept folders 
such as [`lists`](./lists) and [`loops`](./loops).

Extensive discussion of when to use these tools, beyond the examples given,
is out of scope for this project.
