# boot.dev 

This folder contains my notes and code from the Boot.dev backend curriculum,
 focused on skills relevant to MLDE or general DE.

1. Learn to Code in Python [python basics](./python/basics)
2. Learn Linux [Linux](./Linux)
3. Learn Git [git](./git)
4. Learn Object Oriented Programming in Python [python OOP](./python/OOP)
5. Learn SQL [SQL](./SQL)
6. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms in Python [python data structures and algos](./python/data-structures-and-algos)
7. Learn Functional Programming in Python [python functional](./python/functional)
8. Learn Docker [docker](./docker)
9. Learn CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Go [ci cd github actions docker go](./ci-cd-github-actions-docker-go)
10. _(skimmed)_ Learn HTTP Clients in Go [http clients go](./http-clients-go)
11. _(skimmed)_ Learn HTTP Servers in Go [http servers go](./http-servers-go)

Note that 10 and 11 above were skimmed because Go is not a commonly-used language in MLDE 
or regular DE. The purpose was to understand HTTP.

Each folder contains its own README.md file for further explanation.
