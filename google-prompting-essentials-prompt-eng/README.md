# Google Prompting Essentials 

This folder is all about the prompting strategies I learned from Google's Coursera 
certification [Google Prompting Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-start-writing-prompts-like-a-pro/home)

Examples in this folder will be prompt examples, not code.

You can find my [notes from the course](./NOTES.md) here.
