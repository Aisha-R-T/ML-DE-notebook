# ML-DE-notebook

Each folder in this root folder indicates a course taken. The course folders contain 
folders that break down the course by subject. Each subject contains examples of 
concepts that I did not grasp perfectly on the first attempt, plus a NOTES.md file with 
brief syntax reminders and concept breakdowns.

### This is not a Portfolio.

Portfolio is coming later.

This is basically my notes that I want access to while I have my GitHub account open.
