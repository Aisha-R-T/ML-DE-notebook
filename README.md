# ML-DE-notebook

# The gist:
All my mistakes and bumbling about while learning ML DE, plus some very useful notes

# The long-form explanation:

Each folder in this root folder indicates a course taken. The course folders contain 
folders that break down the course by subject. Each subject contains examples of 
concepts that I did not grasp perfectly on the first attempt, plus a NOTES.md file with 
brief syntax reminders and concept breakdowns.

### This is not a Portfolio.

This project is a toolbox. Its purpose is to help me remain prepared for real machine 
learning engineering with a focus on data engineering. 

I'd like to think this project will be useful to others as well, however teaching is not 
the goal of this project.

I include the bugs, the refactors, and the rough edges so that I (and others) can remember 
easy pitfalls.
